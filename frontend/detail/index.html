            <h1 class="data-heading">An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
            <p>
              Let’s see what’s so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve
              with it, and what other technologies play well with it.
            </p>
            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
              <i>JavaScript</i> was initially created to
              <i>“make web pages alive”.</i>
            </p>

            <p>
              The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be
              written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the
              page loads.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need
              special preparation or compilation to run.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
              called Java.
            </p>
            <div class="tag info">
              <p class="tag-title">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>Why is it called
                JavaScript?
              </p>
              <div class="tag-content">
                <p>
                  When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
                  <i>“LiveScript”</i>. But Java was very popular at that time,
                  so it was decided that positioning a new language as a
                  <i>“younger brother”</i> of Java would help.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent
                  language with its own specification called
                  <a href="">ECMAScript</a>, and now it has no relation to Java
                  at all.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on
              the server, or actually on any device that has a special program
              called the <a href="">JavaScript engine</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a
              <i>“JavaScript virtual machine”</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different engines have different <i>“codenames”</i>. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><a href="">V8</a> – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="">
                  <p><a href="">SpiderMonkey </a>– in Firefox.</p>
                </a>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  …There are other codenames like <i>“Chakra” </i>for IE,
                  <i>“JavaScriptCore”</i>, <i>“Nitro”</i> and
                  <i>“SquirrelFish”</i> for Safari, etc.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The terms above are good to remember because they are used in
              developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For
              instance, if <i>“a feature X is supported by V8”</i>, then it
              probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
            </p>
            <div class="tag info">
              <p class="tag-title">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info"></i>How do engines work?
              </p>
              <div class="tag-content">
                <p>Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads
                      (<i>“parses”</i>) the script.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Then it converts (<i>“compiles”</i>) the script to machine
                      code.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</p></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process.
                  It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the
                  data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine
                  code based on that knowledge.
                </p>

            </div>
            <h2>What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h2>
            <p>
              Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
              provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was
              initially created for browsers which do not require it.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s
              running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow
              JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network
              requests, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage
              manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
            </p>
            <p>For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify
                  styles.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements,
                  key presses.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and
                  upload files (so-called <a href="">AJAX</a> and
                  <a href="">COMET</a> technologies).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show
                  messages.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?</h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited to protect the
              user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from
              accessing private information or harming the user’s data.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of such restrictions include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on
                  the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct
                  access to OS functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is
                  limited and only provided if the user does certain actions,
                  like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it
                  via an <span class="tag-html">&lt;input&gt;</span> tag.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone and
                  other devices, but they require a user’s explicit permission.
                  So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a
                  web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information
                  to the <a href="">NSA</a>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other.
                  Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript
                  to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from
                  one page may not access the other page if they come from
                  different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is called the <i>“Same Origin Policy”</i>. To work around
                  that, both pages must agree for data exchange and must contain
                  special JavaScript code that handles it. We’ll cover that in
                  the tutorial.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This limitation is, again, for the user’s safety. A page from
                  <span class="tag-html">http://anysite.com</span> which a user
                  has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with
                  the URL <span class="tag-html">http://gmail.com</span>, for
                  example, and steal information from there.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server
                  where the current page came from. But its ability to receive
                  data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it
                  requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from
                  the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img
              src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javascript-tutorial/vi.javascript.info/609db2bc1a4704e4ebb4d411997b831eaa6e55db/1-js/01-getting-started/1-intro/limitations.svg"
              alt=""
            />
            <p>
              Such limitations do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the
              browser, for example on a server. Modern browsers also allow
              plugins/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.

            <h2>What makes JavaScript unique?</h2>
            <p>There are at least three great things about JavaScript:</p>
            <div class="box">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Full integration with HTML/CSS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Simple things are done simply.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these
              three things.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these
              three things.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most
              widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
            </p>
            <h2>Languages “over” JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different
              people want different features.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are
              different for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are
              transpiled (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the
              browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent,
              actually allowing developers to code in another language and
              auto-converting it “under the hood”.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of such languages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="">CoffeeScript</a> is “syntactic sugar” for
                  JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write
                  clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="">TypeScript</a> is concentrated on adding “strict
                  data typing” to simplify the development and support of
                  complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="">Flow</a> also adds data typing, but in a different
                  way. Developed by Facebook.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="">Dart</a> is a standalone language that has its own
                  engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile
                  apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. Developed by
                  Google.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="">Brython</a> is a Python transpiler to JavaScript
                  that enables the writing of applications in pure Python
                  without JavaScript.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <a href="">Kotlin</a> is a modern, concise and safe
                  programming language that can target the browser or Node.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are more. Of course, even if we use one of these transpiled
              languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand
              what we’re doing.
            </p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language,
                  but it is now used in many other environments as well.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most
                  widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with
                  HTML/CSS.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript
                  and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look
                  at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.
